	"description": "jquery.scrollless plugin allows to gain total control over web page scrolling as well as everything related to document navigation. This is implemented by replacing browser's native scrolling with \"block-wise\" rendering. \"Block-wise\" rendering implies splitting the main content of a web page into smaller pieces (\"blocks\") each of them will be either displayed entirely or hidden",
